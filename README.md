    Description: "I've been passionate about event planning since I was 10, starting with small family gatherings where I coordinated games and decorations. This early interest blossomed as I took on larger roles, organizing school functions and community events. Through years of experience, I've developed a knack for handling everything from venue selection to budget management. Each event presents a new challenge and a canvas for creativity, from corporate gatherings to personal celebrations. My goal is to create memorable experiences that bring people joy and celebration. I am the Creative Director / Team Leader / CEO of Event-Simplified", },
